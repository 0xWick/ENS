## About

* ENS stands for The Ethereum Name Service and it behaves very similar to how DNS behaves
  in the web2 space.
* As we all know that Ethereum has long addresses which are hard to remember or type
* ENS solves this issue by translating these wallet addresses, hashes etc into readable domains
  which are then saved on Ethereum blockchain
* The best part about ENS is unlike DNS servers which are centralized, ENS works with the help
  of a smart contract which is censorship resistant.
* So now when you are sending your wallet address to someone which looks like 0x1234huiahi....
  you can actually send them tom.eth and the ENS would figure out that tom.eth is actually equal
  to your wallet address (0x1234huiahi....)

## Requirements

Its time to build something where we can use ENS.

* We will develop a website which can display the ENS for an address if it has one.

Let's start building ðŸš€

## Basic Installation

## Setup:
First lets get an ENS name for your address, start by opening up https://app.ens.domains/

Make sure when you open the website, your MetaMask is connected to the Rinkeby testnet and it has some Rinkeby Ether

Search for an ENS domain name, any name you like, as long as it is available!


NEXT:

```sh
 npx create-next-app@latest

cd my-app
npm run dev
```
